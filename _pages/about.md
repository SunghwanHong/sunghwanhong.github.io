### M.S./Ph.D. student in the [CVLAB](https://cvlab.korea.ac.kr/ "cvlab")@ [Korea University](https://info.korea.edu/en_info/index.do "korea")
I started my M.S./Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. [Seungryong Kim](https://seungryong.github.io/) since 2021. Before joining CVLAB in Korea University, 
I obtained a barchelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University. My primary research interest is Computer Vision, especially visual correspondence and its applications.
